# darktide-granular-settings
More decimal places for sensitivity and FOV. Also increased minimum and maximum FOV by 20Â°. FOV slider shows lots of decimal places but it should work with no issue otherwise.

# Installation
Drop the granular_settings folder into your mods folder. Add "granular_settings" to your mod_load_order.txt
